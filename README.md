Information related to "Fentanyl shock: The changing geography of overdose in the United States" by Michael Zoorob. 

This project is for my Gov1006 class at Harvard University.

This paper explores fentanyl seizures and deaths in the United States from 2011-2017, namely the increases of both. Zoorob uses two models; Model 1 shows that fentanyl exposure has a positive association with mortality rates, and Model 2 tries to estimate the causal effect of fentanyl exposure on mortality rates. Findings in the paper show that much of the variation in the increased overdose mortality is explained by fentanyl exposure, and that fentanyl deaths are highly correlated with geography, as the epicenter of the overdose crisis has shifted towards the eastern U.S.
